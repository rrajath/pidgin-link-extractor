# pidgin-link-extractor
- Extract URLs from Pidgin logs

## Problem!
People often ping URLs while chatting and we lose track of them as time goes by. But going back to search for one of the URLs in the plethora of log files is annoying and time-consuming.

## Solution!

Link Extractor is a simple tool written in Python where one can search for users to get a complete list of URLs shared by that user so far. These URLs will not be displayed as it is, but more meaningfully by showing the Title of the web page and probably embed videos (for sites like YouTube).
